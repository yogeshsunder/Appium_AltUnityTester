Welcome to AltUnity Tester's documentation!
=============================================

AltUnity Tester is an open-source UI driven test automation tool that helps you find objects in your game and interacts with them using tests written in C#, Python or Java. You can run your tests on real devices (mobile, PCs, etc.) or inside the Unity Editor.
